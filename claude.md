## FGA Authorization Model

### Type Definitions
```
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type organization
  relations
    define super_admin: [user]
    define admin: [user]
    define support: [user]
    define member: [user]

    # Computed permissions based on roles
    # Note: 'member' role has NO permissions - members are managed, not managers
    define can_view: super_admin or admin or support
    define can_reset_mfa: super_admin or admin or support
    define can_invite: super_admin or admin
    define can_add_member: super_admin or admin
    define can_update_roles: super_admin or admin
    define can_remove_member: super_admin or admin
    define can_delete: super_admin
```

**Important**: Roles are assigned directly via write operations. Permissions are computed from roles and should only be checked, never written directly.

### Roles & Permissions Matrix

| Operation | super_admin | admin | support | member |
|-----------|-------------|-------|---------|--------|
| View members | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Reset MFA | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Invite member | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Add member | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Update roles | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Remove member | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Delete member | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

**Note**: Only super_admin, admin, and support roles can log into this app. The `member` role represents regular users in the organization who are being managed - they have no app permissions.

## Architecture

### Layout Design
- **Split UI**: 60% Admin Panel (left) / 40% Chatbot (right)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly with collapsible panels
- **Theme**: Professional blues and grays

### Key Features
1. **Authentication**: Auth0 with OIDC
2. **Authorization**: FGA-based role checks on every operation
3. **Member Management**: Full CRUD with role updates
4. **AI Assistant**: User-scoped agent with OpenAI function calling (See AI-AGENT-AUTH.md)
5. **Security**: CIBA verification for sensitive operations
6. **Visualization**: FGA relationship viewer

### AI Agent Authentication
The chatbot operates as a secure, user-scoped agent:
- **User Context**: Uses logged-in user's session and access token
- **FGA Checks**: Verifies permissions before every operation
- **Function Calling**: OpenAI tools execute real operations (list members, invite, update roles, etc.)
- **CIBA Verification**: Sensitive operations require Guardian Push approval
- **Audit Trail**: All operations logged with user identity

See **AI-AGENT-AUTH.md** for complete documentation.

Available Tools:
- `list_members` - Show organization members (requires can_view)
- `invite_member` - Send email invitation (requires can_invite)
- `add_member` - Add existing user (requires can_add_member)
- `update_member_roles` - Change roles (requires can_update_roles + CIBA)
- `remove_member` - Remove from org (requires can_remove_member + CIBA)
- `delete_member` - Delete user (requires can_delete + CIBA)
- `reset_member_mfa` - Reset MFA (requires can_reset_mfa + CIBA)
- `check_my_permissions` - Show current user's permissions

## Security Considerations

1. **Server-Side FGA Checks**: Every operation must verify permissions via FGA before execution
2. **CIBA for Sensitive Ops**: Update/delete operations require Guardian Push approval
3. **Token Security**: Access tokens never fully exposed in UI (truncated display)
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated with Zod schemas
5. **Environment Variables**: Never commit .env.local (in .gitignore)

## Recent Updates

### Natural Language Input Support (February 9, 2026)

**Chatbot now accepts emails, names, and natural language for all operations**

#### What Changed
All chatbot operations now support natural, human-friendly inputs:
- ✅ "Remove auth0archer@gmail.com" - works directly with email
- ✅ "Reset MFA for john@example.com" - accepts email instead of user ID
- ✅ "Update Jane's roles" - can use names (agent looks up email/ID)
- ✅ "Add existing member john@example.com with admin role" - role names instead of IDs

#### Implementation
1. **Enhanced System Prompt** (`src/lib/openai/client.ts:30-36`):
   - Clear instructions on accepting emails, user IDs, and names
   - Examples showing natural language patterns
   - Guidance on when to look up user details

2. **Updated All Tool Descriptions** (`src/lib/agent/tools.ts:1123-1275`):
   - Every tool clearly states "ACCEPTS EMAIL OR USER ID"
   - Parameter descriptions emphasize email support
   - Role parameters specify "role NAMES" not "role IDs"

3. **Role Name Mapping in inviteMember** (`src/lib/agent/tools.ts:371-398`):
   - Now maps role names to Auth0 role IDs
   - Handles: super_admin, admin, support, member
   - Consistent with addMember and updateMemberRoles

#### Example Commands
```
User: "Remove auth0archer@gmail.com"
Agent: [Calls remove_member with email directly]

User: "Reset MFA for john@example.com"
Agent: [Calls reset_member_mfa with email directly]

User: "Invite sarah@example.com as admin"
Agent: [Calls invite_member with email and "admin" role name]

User: "Update Jane's roles to admin and support"
Agent: [Calls list_members to find Jane, then update_member_roles]
```

#### Key Improvements
- **Zero friction**: Users don't need to know technical IDs
- **Natural commands**: Works with how people actually talk
- **Consistent**: All operations accept the same input formats
- **Smart resolution**: Automatically resolves emails to user IDs behind the scenes
- **Silent operation**: Agent never mentions "looking up" or "finding" - it just works

#### Agent Behavior
The agent now understands to:
1. Accept emails directly from users (any string with "@")
2. Pass email to tool immediately without explanation
3. Let backend silently resolve email → user ID
4. Report only the final result to the user

**User sees:**
```
User: "remove user auth0archer@gmail.com"
Agent: [Guardian Push verification]
Agent: "✅ User removed from organization"
```

**User does NOT see:**
```
❌ "Let me look up that user..."
❌ "Finding the user ID..."
❌ "Searching for the user..."
```

### Human-Readable Agent Responses (February 9, 2026)

**Enhanced chatbot with human-readable formatting for all responses**

#### What Changed
- **Organization Names**: Responses now show "**VibeC0derzz** (\`org_0EgXDHCsaAtl5uhG\`)" instead of just the ID
- **User Names**: Display "**John Doe** (\`auth0|123456789\`)" instead of raw IDs
- **Role Names**: Show "**Admin** (\`admin\`)" with proper formatting
- **Operation Feedback**: Clear messages like "✅ Updated roles for **Jane Smith** in **VibeC0derzz**"

#### Implementation
1. **Helper Functions** (`src/lib/agent/tools.ts:17-69`):
   - `formatRoleName()` - Converts role IDs to human names (super_admin → Super Admin)
   - `formatRoleDisplay()` - Returns formatted role with both name and ID
   - `getOrganizationDetails()` - Fetches and caches org display names

2. **Enhanced Tool Responses**:
   - All tools now return `organizationName`, `userName`, `formattedRoles` fields
   - Success messages include human-readable formatting
   - Lists include both display names and technical IDs

3. **Updated System Prompt** (`src/lib/openai/client.ts:30-52`):
   - Clear formatting rules for organizations, users, roles
   - Instructions to always use formatted fields from tool responses
   - Examples showing proper display format

#### Example Responses

**Before**:
```
You belong to the organization with ID: org_0EgXDHCsaAtl5uhG
```

**After**:
```
You belong to organization **VibeC0derzz** (`org_0EgXDHCsaAtl5uhG`)
```

**Profile Display**:
```
👤 **John Doe**
✉️ john@example.com ✓
User ID: `auth0|123456789`
Organization: **VibeC0derzz** (`org_0EgXDHCsaAtl5uhG`)

Organization Roles from FGA:
• **Admin** (`admin`)
• **Support** (`support`)
```

#### Benefits
- **User-Friendly**: Non-technical users can understand responses
- **Complete**: Technical details still available for troubleshooting
- **Consistent**: All responses follow the same formatting pattern
- **Scannable**: Bold names and code-formatted IDs make information easy to parse

## Previous Updates (February 6, 2026)

### Member Management & FGA Sync Fix
- **Fixed critical bug**: Members now properly added to BOTH Auth0 organizations AND FGA
- **Root cause**: `addMember` function was only writing FGA tuples, not adding to Auth0 org
- **Solution**: Updated both AI agent tools and API routes to:
  - Add member to Auth0 organization
  - Map role names to Auth0 role IDs
  - Assign roles in Auth0
  - Write corresponding FGA tuples for each role
- **Impact**: Member additions now properly sync between Auth0 and FGA authorization

### Complete Auth0 ↔ FGA Synchronization
- **Fixed**: All member operations now sync FGA tuples correctly
- **Operations fixed**:
  - **Add Member**: Creates FGA tuples for assigned roles ✅
  - **Update Roles**: Reads existing tuples, adds new roles, removes old roles ✅
  - **Remove Member**: Deletes ALL FGA tuples for user in organization ✅
- **Smart deletion**: Only deletes tuples that actually exist (prevents FGA validation errors)
- **Activity logging**: All write/delete operations now appear in FGA Activity Monitor
- **Result**: Zero orphaned tuples, complete Auth0/FGA consistency

### MFA Reset Enhancement
- **Fixed**: MFA reset now uses correct Auth0 Management API endpoints
- **Updated endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v2/users/{id}/authentication-methods` - List all MFA methods
  - `DELETE /api/v2/users/{id}/authentication-methods/{id}` - Delete specific method
- **Improvements**:
  - Works with ALL MFA types (SMS, TOTP, Guardian, Email OTP)
  - No pre-check before CIBA (simpler flow)
  - Clear feedback on what was removed
  - Proper error messages for users with no MFA
- **Result**: Successfully resets MFA for all authentication methods, not just Guardian

### UI/UX Improvements

#### Compact Member Cards
- **Reduced size**: 17% smaller avatars (12x12 → 10x10)
- **Tighter spacing**: Cards use `gap-2` instead of `gap-4`
- **Inline layout**: Roles displayed next to name (not separate row)
- **User ID display**: Shows full user ID in monospace font below email
- **Searchable**: Can search by name, email, OR user ID
- **Result**: Fits more members on screen, easier to scan

#### Pinned FGA Inspector
- **Layout restructure**: FGA Activity Panel always visible at top
- **Scrollable area**: Only member list scrolls, not FGA inspector
- **Fixed sections**:
  1. Header (fixed)
  2. FGA Inspector (pinned)
  3. Search bar (pinned)
  4. Member list (scrollable)
- **Benefit**: Monitor FGA activity while scrolling through long member lists

#### Enhanced FGA Activity Feed
- **Stronger feedback**: Shows detailed tuple operations
  - **Created**: `Created tuple: user123 → admin → org:abc`
  - **Deleted**: `Deleted tuple: user456 → support → org:abc`
  - **Checked**: `Checked: user789 can_view org:abc ✓ granted`
- **Visual improvements**:
  - Green checkmark icon for tuple creation
  - Red trash icon for tuple deletion
  - Descriptive text in Recent Activity feed
  - Shortened user/org IDs for readability
- **Result**: Clear visibility into authorization changes

### Favicon Addition
- **Design**: Blue shield with user icon
- **Format**: SVG (scales perfectly)
- **Colors**: Professional blue (#2563eb) matching app theme
- **Location**: `src/app/icon.svg`
- **Auto-generated**: Next.js creates all required sizes
- **Visible in**: Browser tabs, bookmarks, mobile home screen

### AI Agent Enhancements
- **New tool**: `get_member_info` - Get detailed profile for any member
- **Uniform output**: Same profile format as "who am I" command
- **Better MFA handling**: No unnecessary Guardian Push for users without MFA
- **Improved error messages**: Clear feedback on what operations succeeded/failed

### Code Quality
- **Exported**: `getManagementToken()` for reuse across modules
- **Consistent**: Role name/ID handling throughout codebase
- **Validated**: All changes compile without errors
- **Tested**: MFA reset, member addition, FGA sync all working
